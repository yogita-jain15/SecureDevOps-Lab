# 🔐 SecureDevOps Lab

A **secure cloud-deployed web application** built using **DevSecOps principles**, intentionally containing vulnerabilities for testing, learning, and security hardening.  
This project demonstrates **end-to-end IT and cybersecurity skills** — from development and deployment to monitoring and vulnerability management.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Develop a web application with **backend, database, and optional frontend**.
- Deploy on **AWS EC2** using **Docker + Jenkins** for CI/CD.
- Implement **security controls** like SSL/TLS, firewalls, WAF, and RBAC.
- Monitor with **Splunk/ELK**, perform **security scans**, and fix vulnerabilities.
- Create professional **security documentation** for portfolio and interviews.
